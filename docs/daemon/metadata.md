# Metadata processing

The indexer isn't interested in the actual contents of large files,
altough it might be interested in parts of smaller files.

The relevant meta-data mostly consists of things like mime-types,
the size of a picture, when it was created, etc.
Query terms of most relevance are names rather than for example the genre of a song.

One of the most important and basic roles of the project is as an application launcher,
which is based on mime-types almost entierly.
